# ventral_dorsal_model


This repository contains all the codes and pretrianed models used for the experiments reported in the NeurIPS 2021 spotlight paper: "The functional specialization of visual cortex emerges from training parallel pathways with self-supervised predictive learning" ([Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.18.448989v2))


### Requirements
